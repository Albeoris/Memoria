	<Description>This remaster transforms every FMV into true 2k high definition (1920x1440p 4:3) — restoring details lost over time to heavy compression, pixelation, noise, and blur, all while faithfully preserving the original artistic style with professional care, patience, hard work and a lot of time leveraging AI and handmade adjustments, to bring back the timeless beauty of a game that defined a generation, and that, to this day, lives in the hearts of thousands of people.
    
    - This lighter version is highly recommended for PCs/Laptops with 2K or lower screens.

    EACH SCENE HAS BEEN METICULOUSLY RESTORED TO:

    1) Remove compression artifacts and visual noise, resulting in a cleaner, more polished image.
    2) Sharpen and restore fine details in textures, architecture, and character models.
    3) Improve overall clarity and color balance, giving each scene richer tones without oversaturation.
    4) Optimize motion playback through encoding refinements, adjusting frame timing and keyframe placement to enhance smoothness.

    I HOPE YOU ALL ENJOY IT!

She must be met in Alexandria once the Hilda Gard III is obtained and before moving to Terra.

This is actually a lighter version of Alternate Fantasy, to benefit from its added content without changing the extensive modifications of the gameplay. Don't use both simultaneously.</Description>

	<Description>
A hard mod that allows you to experience a new whole adventure! All the monsters and bosses have been redesigned (not only a stats boost but all the AIs are revisited), new skills, mechanics and many other things!

Currently, Trance Seek is...
- A thoughtfully increased difficulty, designed for players seeking challenge (5 difficulties modes available !)
- A complete overhaul of all combat, in terms of stats, AI and skills.
- Around 30 new bosses added (including 2 superbosses): all the game's bosses have been reworked to offer different mechanics and more!
- The game has a total of 84 SA + 84 additional enhanced versions (WIP).
- All characters have 60 SA available (not counting boosted versions, so a total of 120 SA each!).
- Each character has its own unique passive or mechanic. +40 new skills added.
- 59 new items... but more to come !
- And lots more ^_^

This is not an EXTREME hardcore difficult mod: it only adds a higher difficulty than the original version while keeping a constant progression.
But it's still a hard mode ! So be prepared for a challenge... you need to have a good basic understanding of the game (particularly ATB management).
The entire difficulty system will be reworked when Disc 4 is released.

It's currently a demo : Disc1/2/3 available but almost +30 hours of gameplay !
Don't hesitate to try!

Not supported language : Japanese (a lot of things get deleted... need to wait until full release... sorry !)</Description>
	<PatchNotes>
------[0.3.36.2]------

{Characters}
- Zidane will chuckle when a steal succeeds under the effect of "Thief’s Eye"
- Fixed some bugs with Eiko’s passive under specific conditions.
- Fixed Vivi’s animations for high-tier spells.
- Changed Vivi’s SA "Invigorating" to "Last Stand".
- "Mog Flare" and "Mog Holy" are much less likely to be cast against targets under "Reflect".
- New texture for Steiner under "Old" status so it’s more visible, especially under magical barriers like Shell.
- Restored "Aero" and "Aero+" spells to Beatrix’s "Saint Mag" command.
- Fixed Vivi’s Focus effect with "Dbl Blk" when ATB is set to "Wait Mode".
- [WIP] Fixed a specific bug where a character remained invisible after a scripted Trance with the accessory "Ghost Scarf", notably with Vivi against Black Waltz 3 in Disc 1.
- The "Zombie" status no longer prevents fleeing.

{SA / AA Abilities}
- "What’s That!?" is compatible with Thief’s Eye and applies Zidane’s passive to every target.
- "What’s That!?" allows repositioning in any situation, even against bosses.

- Gil bonuses now stack (from SAs or equipment).
- Camera sequences for "Eat" and "Cook" are disabled under certain conditions (notably when damage is dealt).
- Fixed the "Appetite" and "Gluttony" SAs against certain targets, especially humanoids.

- Slight adjustment to the effect of "Zantetsuken" under "Divine guidance".
- Fixed the Gravity spell against certain monsters, especially bosses with scripted deaths.
  With the new Gravity spells added to Vivi, the damage penalty now starts at 2 instead of 1 (damage divided by 2, then 4, 8, 16, 32, etc…).
- Gravity spells are 50% more effective against "Giant"-type enemies (instead of 100%).
  They also gain a 25% damage bonus against Giant-type bosses.
- The abilities "Zeus", "Hikari" and "Zantetsu" have been renamed to "Fulmen", "Sentence" and "Inquisition".

- Fixed and improved the descriptions of several items.

{Monsters and Bosses}

	<Description>This mod adds a new menu that lets you restart the game using your existing save!
You can choose to reset (or not) the following options:
- Your level
- Your abilities (AA/SA)
- Your inventory
- Your treasures (Key Items)
- Your card collection
- Your Gils
- Your playtime

This menu can appear in two different places (you can choose through the options):
- At the end of the game, right before the final cutscene.
- At the last save point of the final dungeon.

This mod is somewhat experimental — I can’t guarantee it won’t cause soft locks, but in theory, all variables are fully reset.
I recommend saving to a new slot when starting this NG+.
Also, this mod is made to be very friendly with other mods, such as Alternate Fantasy, for example.</Description>

	<Description>A very lightweight mod that allows you to modify minor elements of the game while keeping as much of the OG experience as possible.
All options are independent and can be activated as desired.
More options will be added over time.

SA = Support Ability (like UndeadKiller, Mug, AntiBody, etc...)
AA = Active Ability (like Firaga, Cure, Life, Shock, etc...)

Note : To avoid compatibility issues, Quality of the Ifa should be sorted to the lowest priority in the mod list.

	<Description>Chocobo Hot and Cold QoL

Quality-of-life tweaks for Final Fantasy IX’s Chocobo Hot &amp; Cold that respect vanilla progression.
Multiple modes adjust RNG to suit different playstyles, from the untouched classic experience to streamlined options for faster chocograph progression.
Compatible with Alternate Fantasy and Ferny Fantasy.
Load above them in the mod order.

Modes

Chocobo Naturalist (Recommended)

Balanced for real-time play without Turbo.
Averages ~2½ chocographs within the first six digs, with rewards scaling for higher dig counts.
Lets you play a handful of focused sessions, have a good time, and be done — without Turbo and without feeling like you’re cheating.

Chocographer

100% chance to find chocographs and pieces when available.
For players who want quick access to Ozma and rewards without RNG.

Lucky Beak

Speeds up the vanilla turbo experience without turning Hot &amp; Cold into a cheat.
Averages ~2½ chocographs over an eight-dig round, allows multiple finds per session, and keeps RNG intact.
Designed for Turbo play with fewer sessions and steady progress.

Vanilla

Completely untouched Hot &amp; Cold behavior.
Useful as a dedicated override for mods that edit Barrel_38, Barrel_41, or Barrel_46.

	<Description>
A mod that simply consists of changing all your characters into a specific one... have you always dreamed of having four Vivis burning everything? A rain of spears from the sky with your Freyas? Or an army of Quina eating monsters by dozens?

Inspired by the AllQuinaMod mod by Tetra Gomez (aka 8bitmissingno), based on an idea from the Twitch streamer NocturnalHanna.
So why just settle for Quina and do this for all the characters... that's what DV offers in this mod!

NoHardcodedBattles mod already included !
Compatible with the OG version only.

Coming soon : For the next version, I will try to make a mini .dll file so that the mod is compatible with PCP for example.

	<Author>Tirlititi / WarpedEdge</Author>
	<Description>Adds new playable characters to the roster.

Please Note: 
- Still only playable in US Language only (will be fixed in a later release)
- Requires Memoria v2025.05.11 or later
- Currently this mod is not compatible with Trance Seek, but I plan on getting it to eventually
- Currently Alternate Fantasy will have some nuances like Cheat Fate, Fidget, Auto-Protect/Shell missing (this will be fixed in a later update of PCP)

Currently, these characters are added:
- Kuja
- Fratley
- Lani
- Haagen
- Kohel
- Aria (Alexandrian soldier)
- Ophelia (Alexandrian soldier)
- Dan
- Jeame (Cleyra dancer)
- Puck
- Mikoto
- Gerome (Genome)
- Ruby
- Baku

You can press Alt+F2 or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F2 if on Linux in-game to access the party menu (changing the party at any time is a feature of Memoria, not related to this mod).

Special Thanks for their important help:
- LucyHale00 for bug reporting
- HsienkoMegatonDrop for bug reporting
- Emeiru (support)
- Hope (scripting)
- faospark (concept art)
- samtoki (character portraits)
- DV (ability sequences and features)

You should set the priority of this mod to be higher than the priority of the Moguri mod but lower than other mods, but until Alternate Fantasy's next update, put this mod's priority above it</Description>

<Description>[!] A new save game is recommended [!]
Removes the equipment stat-boosting mechanic and replaces it with a fixed additional per level stat-gain. Players will no longer need to mind their equipment and wear stat-boosting gear on level-up. Party members will always achieve a fixed maximum stat just by leveling. Note that this will naturally decrease the difficulty of the game due to stats having linear progression now. A new save game is required to apply these changes, but if you installed this mod mid-game, you can also visit Chocobo's Forest to inject the mod's changes, level up, and see the new stats.

Choose ONLY one of the three stats settings:

Perfect Stats
- Partially based on KADFC Max Stats Guide, this setting will allow the party to achieve near-perfect stats as if they pursued a level 1 max stats run. Significantly decreases game difficulty due to overall higher stats.

Perfect Rebalanced
- Max stats configuration by Emeiru, aims to buff party members with low combined stats and make it rebalanced across the board. 

No Bonus Stat Growth
- Completely removes the bonus stat growth formula. Optional choice to remove stat management altogether, making the game harder.

Optional: Fixed Magic Stones
- Reworks the magic stone growth formula to ensure every party member will get their max number of magic stones.</Description>

	<Category>Gameplay</Category>
	<Description>A complete combat overhaul mod aimed to bring a new feel to the battle system and crank the difficulty up a few notches.


This mod includes an overhaul of MANY systems, including brand new passives, character skills, tons of new items, mini-bosses, revamped boss battles,
and so much more.This mod is a WIP and I highly appreciate any and all feedback you might have so that I can make it as great as it can be. I hope you enjoy what I've done!


*** IMPORTANT ***
This mod was balanced with `Turn-Based ATB` mode in mind. Make sure to enable it to experience the mod the way it was intended to be played. Buff/debuff durations and
boss mechanics are all tuned around the ATB not "ticking" while animations are playing (as they do in other ATB modes), and this will greatly impact the flow of combat
if not set.


{Load Order, Incompatibility, and Credits}
[Mods and Load Order:]
    (1) Ferny Fantasy IX - 'Place above AF'
    (2) Alternate Fantasy - 'REQUIRED'


[Optional] 
    * FernyDifficultyTweaks - Ferny Fantasy is already a significant difficulty spike compared to vanilla, only use this mod if you want even more challenge. Place it above FernyFantasy.


[Optional]
    * Kupo UI Suite - 'place my mod above theirs to use my custom title screen, otherwise, you can place Kupo UI Suite above mine to use one of their titles.'


[Optional]
    * All graphical and music mods are compatible with Ferny Fantasy.


[Incompatibility]
My mod is not compatible with any of the following mods (more details in CREDITS section).
    (1) Kupo Heroes Pack (see Credits)
    (2) Amazing Vivi, Steiner, Garnet, etc. Series (See Credits)
    (3) Amazing Abilities - Both mods replace "Healer" Support Ability
    (4) David Bowie Edition - my mod REQUIRES Alternate Fantasy and AF is incompatible with DB.
    (5) Trance Seek - Both aim to overhaul the game but in different ways. 
    (5) FernySupportTweaks - Redundant to use with this mod as they do the same thing with support abilities.
    (6) FernyTranceTweaks - Redundant to use with this mod as they do the same thing with support abilities.


[Credit]
Credit will go to where it is rightfully deserved. I took a lot of the best ideas, skills, passives, spells, items, etc. of some of the above mentioned mods and combined them into my mod for maximum compatibility. They did amazing work with the mods they made, but there were some compatibility issues if you wanted to use them all AND Alternate Fantasy together. Now, with my mod, that is possible. I want to say thank you to the following:


{Emeiru} - Creator of the "Amazing Character" Series and "Perfect Stats." His code was used as a base for the Attributess/Magic Stones formulas in my mod. Adopted his "Bye Auto Potion" and the majority of his AF patched support abilities for each character.


{WarpedEdge} - Creator of the "Playable Characters Pack" for all their help and inspiration. 


{Faospark} - Creator of "Kupo Heroes Pack." I adapted a ton of his spells/abilities, such as Aero, Quake, Water, etc. series, as well about 70% of the passives for each of the characters in that pack. 


{DV} - Trance Seek mod author for assisting me with a handful of codes that I was having trouble with.


{Tirlititi} - Alternate Fantasy mod author for his amazing work with Alternate Fantasy, assisting me with code, and of course all his contributions to the FF9 modding community. Seriously dude, thank you.

	<Description>Changes some Support Abilities to be "subjectively" more useful! You can enable as many as you want. 


Divine Light - (Replaces "Auto-Reflect" Support Ability)
- Completely drains the Trance bar to stop a character from being KO'd if the Trance bar is at least 50% full.


Trancer - (Replaces "Ability Up" Support Ability)
- All attacks now slightly increase the Trance gauge.
- High Tide increases the amount of Trance gained.
- HIGHLY suggested you use this option with "Kupo Tweaks or Exp , AP, Gil , Rewards Modifier" mod to alter AP gains from losing the Ability Up support ability.


Gambling Strikes - (Replaces Zidane's "Bandit" Support Ability)
- Zidane's damage output randomly ranges from 50% to 200%.
- HIGHLY suggested you enable "100% Steal Rate" cheat in Memoria engine to offset losing the Bandit support ability.


Glass Cannon - (Replaces "Auto-Float" Support Ability)
- Increases all damage dealt by 60%, but reduces MaxHP by 40%.


Dyne Booster - (Zidane Only)
- All of Zidane's Trance abilities deals 2x damage when his HP falls below 20%.
- Damage at endgame will easily hit 9,999 damage cap when this triggers.
- (OPTIONAL) Enable "Break Damage Limit" cheat in Memoria Engine to allow damage to break 9,999 cap.


Defence+ - (Replaces "Gambler Defense" Support Ability)
- Gambler Defense was an abysmally useless Special Ability.
- Now increases Defence and Magic Defence by 5%.


Lucky! - (Replaces "Level Up" Support Ability)
- There are a few mods out there that allow you that alter your EXP gain... so, I figured the "Level Up" support ability could get a facelift. 
- Now increases Critical Strike Chance by 10!


HP Leech - (Replaces "Add Status" Support Ability)
- Attacks will now leech a small amount of HP from the target to heal the user.
- The "Add Status" is now a global passive - no longer needing to be equipped for the effect to be active. Always found it kinda pointless to add Status Effects to weapons and then making them moot if you didn't have this Support Ability equipped. 


MP Leech - (Replaces "MP Attack" Support Ability)
- Attacks will now leech a small amount of MP from the target to heal the user.
- This ability makes sense in my game because I'm playing the Alternate Fantasy mod and almost all my characters now have skills that deal damage and use MP, so there is no reason to drain my MP to use a regular attack when I could just use one of my skills and do the same thing.


Speed+ - (Replaces "Flee-Gil" Support Ability)
- Flee-Gil is actual doodoo, now it's actually useful!
- Now increases Speed by 10%.

	<Description>A modular Final Fantasy IX Trance system overhaul!

Do you think the Trance system in Final Fantasy IX is a steaming hot pile of... well, you know.
Well, look no further! I introduce to you the newest addition to my gameplay overhaul suite: Ferny Trance Tweaks!

With this mod, you can overhaul the way you utilize Trance in Final Fantasy IX and make it into something MUCH better * subjectively *
than it was in the base game.

Options include:

Trance - Overhaul System
* Disables `Auto-Trance` when the gauge fills up and allows the player to activate Trance when they choose to do so.
* Allows the player to build their Trance Gauge on every action, no longer just when they take damage.
* `High Tide` Support Ability increases the amount of Trance gained on all actions.


Trance - MP Reduction
* Reduces MP costs of Blue Magic, White Magic, Black Magic, and Summons while in Trance by 50%.


Trance - Crit Boost
* Applies an innate +25% bonus to Critical Hit Chance while in Trance.


Trance - Patch for `Ferny Support Tweaks`
* Includes everything in the `Overhaul System` option.
* FernySupportTweaks adds a new Support Ability: `Trancer` which allows the player to build Trance via offensive actions. this has been coded into this mod and is now redundant. This patch changes up `Trancer` with `Spirit+` which instead increases Spirit by +5% (which helps scale the amount of Trance you gain on all actions).

Each time you complete a section, you will be notified.

Forget all abilities
Be reset to default equipment

You will then have to use only what the game provides in the upcoming section to beat it.
Good luck!</Description>

	<Description>Turn Zidane's 3D model on the field and in battles into Kuja's 3D model.
The animations on the field are messed up.

You should better use the Playable Characters Pack instead. This later one doesn't aim to replace Zidane by Kuja on the field but is less experimental.</Description>

	<Description>Mistwake UI is more than just a visual overhaul of Final Fantasy IX — it’s a tribute.
Created by fans who grew up mesmerized by every detail of this masterpiece, the mod was born out of a desire to give back for the impact the game had on our lives. With a respectful and meticulous reinterpretation, we aimed to honor everything that made FFIX a classic of the 2000s, enhancing its beauty through a fresh perspective.

This version includes:

A redesigned look for menus, interface, dialogue boxes, and other refined elements
New portraits for all characters, including side characters and extras
Exclusive new artwork for each of the 8 protagonists at the moment they are recruited
New background illustrations for the title screen, Game Over, and disc transitions
New map name presentations, now accompanied by icons that represent each location
Mistwake is a love letter to the world of Gaia — and a gift to everyone who, like us, was moved by it.

PT-BR

Mistwake UI é mais do que uma repaginação visual de Final Fantasy IX — é uma homenagem.
Criado por fãs que cresceram encantados com cada detalhe dessa obra-prima, o mod nasceu do desejo de retribuir o impacto que o jogo teve em nossas vidas. Com uma releitura respeitosa e detalhista, buscamos valorizar tudo o que fez de FFIX um clássico dos anos 2000, exaltando sua beleza com um novo olhar.

Esta versão inclui:
Novo visual para menus, interface, caixa de diálogo e outros elementos refinados
Novos retratos para todos os personagens, incluindo secundários e extras
Novas artes exclusivas para cada um dos 8 protagonistas no momento em que são recrutados
Novas artes de fundo, para a tela inicial, Game Over e transições de disco
Novas apresentações dos nomes de mapas, agora acompanhadas por ícones que representam cada local

Mistwake é uma carta de amor ao mundo de Gaia — e um presente para todos que, como nós, se emocionaram com ele.
</Description>
	<PatchNotes>IMPORTANT: To experience the mod in its most refined form, we recommend using the Newsreader 14pt font. It is not enabled by default, but it is included in the mod package. Simply install it and select it manually in the Memoria launcher settings to enjoy all the visual elegance that Mistwake offers.

PT-BR

IMPORTANTE: Para vivenciar o mod em sua forma mais refinada, recomendamos o uso da fonte Newsreader 14pt. Ela não está ativada por padrão, mas está inclusa no pacote do mod. Basta instalá-la e selecioná-la manualmente nas configurações no launcher do Memoria e aproveitar toda a elegância visual que Mistwake propõe.</PatchNotes>

    <Description>Replaces the battle music with either remixes of original songs (from FFIX) or tracks from other video games (both original &amp; remixed). Multiple choices for a single track to choose from, as Ferny would say "Best of both worlds!", enjoy! 
--Echoes of Gaia (formerly known as "Specific Fights") is an optional music expansion that replaces all battle music with individual songs, giving FFIX the epic feeling of a remake we've longed deserved (And probably will never get).

Current Music List:
Battle 1 has currently 6 Custom Tracks
Swords of Fury has currently 3 Custom Tracks
Victory Fanfare has currently 3 Custom Track
Battle 2 has currently 8 Custom Tracks
Run! has currently 7 Custom Tracks
Faerie Battle has currently 2 Custom Tracks
Festival of the Hunt has currently 3 Custom Tracks
The Wavering Blade has currently 5 Custom Tracks
Ambush Attack has currently 1 Custom Tracks
Something to Protect has currently 4 Custom Tracks
Not Alone has currently 2 Custom Tracks
Dark Messenger has currently 5 Custom Tracks
Final Battle has currently 3 Custom Tracks

If you would like to listen to replaced/custom tracks early on:

Method 1:
-Start the game via Memoria
-In the main menu press Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S to open the Sound View
-Go to BGM and click the music ID you'd wish to listen to. More details on this website:
 https://github.com/Albeoris/Memoria/wiki/List-of-musics

-Tracks for Echoes of Gaia start from Sounds01/BGM_/music123 (149)

Method 2:
-Playlists on YouTube:

	<Description>This is the old 2020 version of the Moguri backgrounds, but with all the rest (textures, UI, fixes, edge cutting, lights...) from Moguri 9. This version's backgrounds are more pixel-perfect, paint-like, but noisier.

Moguri Mod is a rework of FFIX's visuals, helped by AI and polished with love. It's a faithful experience aimed at new players, veterans and nostalgic people alike

- HD backgrounds (faithfully aided by AI, merged and polished by hand)
- All 11k layer edges manually redrawn
- Overhaul of all model textures
- Improved FMVs that merge with backgrounds
- HD places names, using original fonts
- Rework of some UI elements (maps, minimap, menu...)
- HD chocographs (based on Caledor's work with permission)
- Visual bugfixes (some by SamsamTS)

Note: 30fps videos and the alternative soundtrack are now separate mods</Description>
	<PatchNotes>Version 8.4 has the same backgrounds as 8.3, but with some redone layer edges, lights, new battle textures, UI elements, NPC, bugfixes...</PatchNotes>

	<Description>A mod that replaces old item, spell and UI names / labels to their modern counterparts or their now known consistent naming convention 
Ideal for those who were introduced to the series post final fantasy 12. Simply activate and that should work. 
For now the primary focus of the mod is the US and UK translation of the game, so non-English language players feel free to message me if you have suggestions or requests for your language of choice.

	<Description>Tradução totalmente revisada e atualizada para ser usada somente com o Mod Moguri. O jogo está completamente traduzido, incluindo história principal, diálogos secundários, sidequests, informações e outras coisas.

Informações Importantes
- Não foram traduzidos os nomes dos Itens, equipamentos e magias. Fiz essa escolha para melhor experiência dos veteranos e iniciantes.
- Ao baixar a tradução existe duas opções na pasta de instalação: 30 FPS e 60 FPS. Instale somente a versão correspondente que queira usar.
- Alguns mods são imcompatíveis com a tradução pois susbstituem os arquivos de texto ou de textura. Então verifique bem antes de instala-los.
- Para jogar a versão 60 FPS basta baixar e executar a útima versão do Memoria, encontrada aqui: (https://github.com/Albeoris/Memoria/releases/tag/v2023.06.11)

Para ver o tutorial de como instalar a tradução e acompanhar atualizações e conteúdos de FFIX entrem no meu canal.

Créditos:
- Harleyquinn: Porte para versão Moguri
- dkPsycho: Toda parte de tradução, revisão e melhoria
- JonasJTG: Edição dos Gráficos

	<Description>                        水晶的记忆    十七载的传承

        ChineseFFSkyRebirth 是一款基于 Memoria 引擎开发的中文mod，全面继承了 2008 年 《最终幻想 IX》PS 版汉化版的所有元素，并在此基础上进行了进一步的优化与提升。

        本作不仅完整保留了当年汉化组的工作成果，还在Memoria引擎的帮助下进行了多项增强，使得这款经典汉化版在新技术的加持下焕发新生。

        包括：1、天幻版文本移植与改进。2、含文字的图片汉化。3、所有场景地名图片汉化且调整尺寸适应大屏幕。4、开场和结局动画的优化处理。

        我们致敬原最终幻想9汉化组的所有成员，诚挚感谢memoria引擎成员Tirlititi的无私帮助，同时也向为本mod付出热情和贡献的朋友致以最高的敬意。

        Team "Tribute to FFIX cn 2008" 祝您游戏愉快！</Description>
	<PatchNotes>Version 0.9 为最终幻想IX 2008年ps版汉化的移植作品，在此基础上重新制作和调整了全部图片部分，以及结局动画。</PatchNotes>
