##  The format for coding Supporting Ability features is the following:
##  >SA {ID} {Comment}
##  {Feature Type 1} {Feature Arguments 1 (possibly on multiple lines)}
##  {Feature Type 2} {Feature Arguments 2 (possibly on multiple lines)}
##  etc...

##  The format for coding Active Ability features is the following:
##  >AA {ID} {Comment}
##  {Feature 1}
##  {Feature 2}
##  etc...
##  
#####################################################################################################
##  
##  Generic comments should be placed at the beginning of the file
##  The 64 supporting abilities must be defined in the main AbilityFeatures.txt
##  However, only a part of them can be present in AbilityFeatures.txt of mod folders
##  
##  A special group of features can be optionally defined using ">SA Global" or ">SA GlobalLast"
##  Features in these global blocks will always apply,
##  even when no Supporting Ability is active, even for enemies
##  These Global feature blocks can be used to link features with pieces of equipment
##  The "Global" block applies before other supporting abilities while "GlobalLast" applies after
##  
##  Features of active abilities are optional; there can be features for each one of them or for none
##  
#####################################################################################################
##  
##  It is important for the keywords ">SA", ">AA" and for the feature types to be at the start of a new line
##  The ID of a ">SA" must be a number between 0 and 63 corresponding to the supporting ability
##  (0 is the first one, Auto-Reflect by default, and 63 is the last one that is unused by default)
##  The ID of a ">AA" must be a number between 0 and 191 corresponding to the active ability
##  (0 is Void, and 191 is Doomsday Sword)
##  Everything on the same line after the ID is ignored

##  There are 6 different feature types for supporting abilities:
##  
##  Permanent -> Applies as soon as the ability is enabled (refreshes when equipment changes),
##    typically for stat modifications of a player character
##    Arguments:
##      [code=Condition] {Formula} [/code] -> Define a condition for the feature to apply
##      [code={Prop.}] {Formula} [/code]   -> Modify the property according to the formula
##  
##  BattleStart -> Applies when a battle is triggered, at the moment of picking the start type,
##    typically for changing the chances to have a back attack or preemptive start type
##    Arguments:
##      [code=Condition] {Formula} [/code] -> Define a condition for the feature to apply
##      [code={Prop.}] {Formula} [/code]   -> Modify the property according to the formula
##      PreemptivePriority {DELTA}         -> Use "PreemptivePriority +1" for letting preemptive have
##                                        priority over back attacks (in case both random checks pass)
##  
##  StatusInit -> Applies a status modification at the start of each battle
##    Arguments:
##      [code=Condition] {Formula} [/code] -> Define a condition for the feature to apply
##      AutoStatus {Status Name}           -> Let the character have a permanent status
##      InitialStatus {Status Name}        -> Let the character start the battle with a status
##      ResistStatus {Status Name}         -> Let the character be immune to a status
##      InitialATB {ATB Pourcent}          -> Fill the character's ATB at start (100 for a full gauge)
##  
##  Ability -> Apply an effect at some point during an ability's effect calculation
##    typically for increasing the power of some attacks or triggering a reaction
##    Arguments:
##      EvenImmobilized                    -> (Try to) apply the feature even if the SA user has a
##                                        status amongst Death, Petrify, Venom, Stop, Freeze, Jump
##      AsTarget                           -> Apply the feature if the SA user is one of the target(s)
##                                        instead of being the caster (default)
##      When{Moment}                       -> Pick the moment to apply the feature amongst these:
##                                        WhenBattleScriptStart (before the CS script is called)
##                                        WhenHitRateSetup (right before hit rate/evasion checks)
##                                        WhenCalcDamage (right before calculating HPDamage using
##                                                        Attack, AttackPower and DefensePower)

##                                        for the rest of the ability's effect calculation
##                                        (even for a different moment but not for a different target)
##  
##  Command -> Apply an effect when a battle command is executed by anyone on anywho
##    typically for letting a character cover an ally or modifying a flag before visual effect
##    Arguments:
##      EvenImmobilized                    -> (Try to) apply the feature even if the SA user has a
##                                        status amongst Death, Petrify, Venom, Stop, Freeze, Jump

##    Arguments:
##      When{Moment}                       -> Pick the moment to apply the feature amongst these:

##                                        WhenRewardAll (modifies rewards of the whole team)
##                                        WhenRewardSingle (default - modifies rewards of the SA user)
##                                          (Note that "WhenRewardAll" only applies once even if
##                                           there are several users of the same SA in the team)

##  Examples:
##  
##  
##  Make the claws Avenger start the battle with Doom
##  Also triggers a counter-attack with the sword Defender when the character is defending
##  Also make the staff Mace of Zeus reduce MP cost of all spells to 0
##  Also make blinded characters be mistaken on their single-target actions
##  
##  >SA Global
##  StatusInit [code=Condition] WeaponId == 47 [/code] InitialStatus Doom
##  Ability AsTarget
##   [code=Condition] TargetWeaponId == 25 && CheckAnyStatus(TargetCurrentStatus, 32768) && CommandId <= 47 && CasterIsPlayer != TargetIsPlayer && (AbilityCategory & 8) != 0 [/code]
##   [code=Counter] 176 [/code]
##   DisableSA 36 54 56
##  Permanent [code=Condition] WeaponId == 78 [/code] [code=MPCostFactor] 0 [/code]
##  Command EvenImmobilized
##   [code=Condition] IsTheCaster && IsSingleTarget && !IsSelfTarget && (CheckAnyStatus(CurrentStatus, 16) || CheckAnyStatus(PermanentStatus, 16)) [/code]
##   [code=CommandTargetId] TargetPosition < CasterPosition ? GetRandomBit(BattleFilter((1 << CasterPosition) - 1, TargetIsPlayer ? 1 : 0, 1, 1 << 30)) : GetRandomBit(BattleFilter(256 - 2 * (1 << CasterPosition), TargetIsPlayer ? 1 : 0, 1, 1 << 30)) [/code]
##  
##  
##  Give Auto-Shell or Auto-Protect depending on which one is the most useful
##  and give both if Defence == MagicDefence
##  
##  >SA 0
##  StatusInit [code=Condition] Defence <= MagicDefence [/code] AutoStatus Protect
##  StatusInit [code=Condition] MagicDefence <= Defence [/code] AutoStatus Shell
##  
##  
##  Save the user from fatal damage at the cost of half of the trance gauge (max is 255),
##  and add Berserk, Vanish and Reflect permanently when doing so
##  Note that EffectTargetFlags is a bit flags consisting of the followings:
##   1  -> Ability deals HP damage
##   2  -> Ability heals HP instead of damaging (both bits are set)
##   4  -> Critical strike connected
##   8  -> Ability deals MP damage
##   16 -> Ability heals MP instead of damaging (both bits are set)
##  So "(EffectTargetFlags & 3) == 1" verifies that the ability deals damage and doesn't heal
##  Also note that the effect triggers both if the user is in trance and if s/he is not
##  
##  >SA 1
##  Ability AsTarget WhenBattleScriptEnd
##  [code=Condition] HPDamage >= TargetHP && TargetTrance >= 128 && (EffectTargetFlags & 3) == 1

##  [code=HPDamage] 0 [/code]
##  
##  
##  Make battles 1/2 preemptives, 1/4 back attacks (the preemptive check has to fail)
##  and also give Long Reach to all the player's characters
##  
##  >SA 2
##  BattleStart PreemptivePriority +1
##  [code=Preemptive] 128 [/code]
##  [code=BackAttack] 128 [/code]
##  Command EvenImmobilized
##  [code=Condition] IsAllyOfCaster [/code]
##  [code=IsShortRanged] false [/code]
##  
##  
##  Cast Cura as a counter on an ally that uses an ability on the SA user
##  Note that the user doesn't need to know the spell to use it as a counter (but it costs MP)
##  Note also that it will trigger on any command, including counters, thus potentially looping
##  
##  >SA 3
##  Ability AsTarget
##  [code=Condition] CasterIsPlayer == TargetIsPlayer && CasterHP < CasterMaxHP
##                && CasterCharacterIndex != TargetCharacterIndex [/code]
##  [code=Counter] 2 [/code]
##  
##  
##  Give a 1.5x, 2.5x or 5x bonus experience depending on the user's level
##  Note that using floating point arithmetic instead of integer arithmetic
##  will round the result to the closest integral value instead of flooring it
##  The format "{condition} ? {formula 1} : {formula 2}" uses the 1st formula
##  if the condition is satisfied and uses the 2nd formula if not
##  
##  >SA 4
##  BattleResult [code=BonusExp] Level < 40 ? 1.5 * BonusExp :

##  Active ability features work similarly as supporting ability features but consist of [code][/code] tags only
##  Most of the time, formulas should use the format "{condition} ? {formula 1} : {formula 2}" in order to be efficient
##  
##  There are 7 possible different tags:
##  
##  [code=Patch] {Formula} [/code]          -> Swap the ability with another one
##                                         This affects the ability in battles but also in the menu
##  
##  [code=Priority] {Formula} [/code]       -> Change the command's priority, to make it trigger as soon as inputted
##  
##  [code=GilCost] {Formula} [/code]        -> Add a gil cost to the cast of the ability
##  
##  [code=Element] {Formula} [/code]        -> Dynamically change the ability's element
##  
##  [code=Status] {Formula} [/code]         -> Dynamically change the ability's status
##  
##  [code=Target] {Formula} [/code]         -> Redefine the command's target(s)
##  
##  [code=SpecialEffect] {Formula} [/code]  -> Dynamically change the ability's special effect
##  
#####################################################################################################
##  
##  The feature "Patch" applies at any time
##  Its formula may include the same variables and functions as a "Permanent" supporting ability feature
##  
##  The feature "Priority" applies as soon as a command is sent (either as a player input or as a reaction)
##  Its formula may include the same variables and functions as below for the other features
##  
##  The other features apply when the command starts, on the tick before the "Command" supporting ability features take effect
##  before the setup of a few informations ("IsCovered" will always return false, for example)
##  Their formulas may include these variables and functions:
##    Common variables and functions, IsSingleTarget, IsSelfTarget, AreCasterAndTargetEnemies, AreCasterAndTargetAllies,
##    CasterMaxHP, CasterMaxMP, CasterMaxATB, CasterHP, CasterMP, CasterATB, CasterTrance, CasterInTrance, CasterModelId,
##    CasterCurrentStatus, CasterPermanentStatus, CasterResistStatus, CasterHalfElement, CasterGuardElement, CasterAbsorbElement,
##    CasterWeakElement, CasterBonusElement, CasterWeaponPower, CasterWeaponRate, CasterWeaponElement, CasterWeaponStatus,
##    CasterWeaponCategory, CasterWeaponId, CasterHeadId, CasterWristId, CasterArmorId, CasterAccessoryId,
##    CasterSerialNumber, CasterRow, CasterPosition, CasterSummonCount, CasterIsPlayer, CasterIsSlave, CasterIsOutOfReach,
##    CasterLevel, CasterExp, CasterSpeed, CasterStrength, CasterMagic, CasterSpirit, CasterDefence, CasterEvade,
##    CasterMagicDefence, CasterMagicEvade, CasterPlayerCategory, CasterCategory, CasterCharacterIndex,
##    CasterIsStrengthModified, CasterIsMagicModified, CasterIsEvadeModified, CasterIsDefenceModified,
##    CasterIsMagicDefenceModified, CasterIsMagicEvadeModified, CasterCriticalRateBonus, CasterCriticalRateWeakening,
##    CasterHasSA(support ability ID)
##    CommandId, AbilityId, ScriptId, Power, AbilityStatus, AbilityElement, AbilityElementForBonus,
##    ItemUseId, WeaponThrowShape, SpecialEffectId, TargetType, IsATBCommand, IsAbilityMultiTarget, IsShortSummon,
##    IsSpellReflected, IsCovered, IsDodged, IsShortRanged, IsReflectNull, IsMeteorMiss, AbilityCategory, MPCost,
##    AbilityFlags, CommandTargetId, CalcMainCounter

##  Examples:
##  
##  
##  Alternate between Fenrir (Earth) and Fenrir (Wind) when casting it, 
##  instead of patching the ability depending on Eiko's accessory
##  
##  >AA 66 Fenrir
##  [code=Patch] GetAbilityUsageCount(66) <= GetAbilityUsageCount(67) ? 66 : 67 [/code]
##  
##  
##  Curse elemental weaknesses using Amarant's weapon element when applicable,
##  and a random element if Amarant's weapon has none
##  Both of these formulas are valid for picking a random element
##  
##  >AA 129 Curse (single)
##  [code=Element] CasterWeaponElement != 0 ? CasterWeaponElement : (1 << GetRandom(0, 8)) [/code]
##  >AA 137 Curse (multi)
##  [code=Element] CasterWeaponElement != 0 ? CasterWeaponElement : GetRandomBit(255) [/code]
##  
##  
##  Have summons take priority over the other commands, once per character per battle
##  
##  >AA 49 Shiva
##  [code=Priority] CasterSummonCount <= 1 ? 1 : -1 [/code]
##  >AA 51 Ifrit
##  [code=Priority] CasterSummonCount <= 1 ? 1 : -1 [/code]
##  >AA 53 Ramuh
##  [code=Priority] CasterSummonCount <= 1 ? 1 : -1 [/code]
##  etc...
##  
##  
##  Have Shell upgrade to Mighty Guard if Concentrate is equipped
##  Note that returning the value -1 will not apply any change
##  
##  >AA 11 Shell
##  [code=Patch] HasSA(33) ? 84 : -1 [/code]
##  
##  
##  Have Haste upgrade to a party-wide spell if Concentrate is equipped
##  Note that the SFX Rework system allows to use the special effect Haste (89) on multiple targets
##  but it has to be switched to Carbuncle's Emerald effect (506) if that system is deactivated
##  
##  >AA 13 Haste
##  [code=Target] HasSA(33) ? BattleFilter(255, 1, 1, CombineStatuses(256, 1 << 30)) : -1 [/code]
##  [code=SpecialEffect] HasSA(33) ? (UseSFXRework ? 89 : 506) : -1 [/code]
