##  The format for coding Supporting Ability features is the following:
##  >SA {ID} {Comment}
##  {Feature Type 1} {Feature Arguments 1 (possibly on multiple lines)}
##  {Feature Type 2} {Feature Arguments 2 (possibly on multiple lines)}
##  etc...

## 
##  The format for coding Active Ability features is the following:
##  >AA {ID} {Comment}
##  {Feature 1}
##  {Feature 2}
##  etc...
##  
#####################################################################################################
##  
##  Generic comments should be placed at the beginning of the file
##  The 64 supporting abilities must be defined in the main AbilityFeatures.txt
##  However, only a part of them can be present in AbilityFeatures.txt of mod folders
##  
##  A special group of features can be optionally defined using ">SA Global" or ">SA GlobalLast"
##  Features in these global blocks will always apply, even when no Supporting Ability is active
##  These Global feature blocks can be used to link features with pieces of equipment
##  The "Global" block applies before other supporting abilities while "GlobalLast" applies after
##  
##  Similarly, other specialfeatures can be optionally defined using ">SA GlobalEnemy" or ">SA GlobalEnemyLast"
##  Features in these global blocks will be used by enemies instead of player characters
##  Enemy features can be only of type "StatusInit", "Ability" or "Command"
##  
##  Features of active abilities are optional; there can be features for each one of them or for none
##  
#####################################################################################################
##  
##  It is important for the keywords ">SA", ">AA" and for the feature types to be at the start of a new line
##  The ID of a ">SA" must be a number corresponding to the supporting ability
##  (0 is the first one, Auto-Reflect by default; 63 is Void, unused by default)
##  The ID of a ">AA" must be a number corresponding to the active ability
##  (0 is Void; 191 is Doomsday Sword, the last one that is used by default)
##  
##  Optionally, writing "+" after the ID cumulates the features across mods:
##  Without "+", all the features tied to that ability's ID that are defined in mods of lower priorities are cleared
##  With "+", the features defined are added on top of the base features
##  Generally, it is better to use this option for ">SA Global+"
##  (eg. to keep Healing Rod's effect when adding an unrelated global effect)
##  
##  Everything on the same line after the ID and the optional "+" is ignored
##

##  There are 6 different feature types for supporting abilities:
##  
##  Permanent -> Applies as soon as the ability is enabled (refreshes when equipment changes),
##    typically for stat modifications of a player character
##    Arguments:
##      [code=Condition] {Formula} [/code] -> Define a condition for the feature to apply
##      [code={Prop.}] {Formula} [/code]   -> Modify the property according to the formula
##  
##  BattleStart -> Applies when a battle is triggered, at the moment of picking the start type,
##    typically for changing the chances to have a back attack or preemptive start type
##    Arguments:
##      [code=Condition] {Formula} [/code] -> Define a condition for the feature to apply
##      [code={Prop.}] {Formula} [/code]   -> Modify the property according to the formula
##      PreemptivePriority {DELTA}         -> Use "PreemptivePriority +1" for letting preemptive have
##                                        priority over back attacks (in case both random checks pass)
##  
##  StatusInit -> Applies a status modification at the start of each battle
##    Arguments:
##      [code=Condition] {Formula} [/code]                   -> Define a condition for the feature to apply
##      AutoStatus {Status Name}                             -> Let the character have a permanent status
##      InitialStatus {Status Name}                          -> Let the character start the battle with a status
##      ResistStatus {Status Name}                           -> Let the character be immune to a status
##      InitialATB {ATB Pourcent}                            -> Fill the character's ATB at start (100 for a full gauge)
##      [code=PartialResist{Status Name}] {Formula} [/code]  -> Let the character have a status-specific evasion
##                                                          0.0: no bonus evasion -- 1.0: always evade that status
##      [code=DurationFactor{Status Name}] {Formula} [/code] -> Change the duration of specific statuses for the character
##                                                          1.0: normal duration
##  
##  Ability -> Apply an effect at some point during an ability's effect calculation

##  Active ability features work similarly as supporting ability features but consist of [code][/code] tags only
##  Most of the time, formulas should use the format "{condition} ? {formula 1} : {formula 2}" in order to be efficient
##  
##  There are 10 possible different tags:
##  
##  [code=Patch] {Formula} [/code]              -> Swap the ability with another one
##                                             This affects the ability in battles but also in the menu
##  
##  [code=Priority] {Formula} [/code]           -> Change the command's priority, to make it trigger as soon as inputted
##  
##  [code=GilCost] {Formula} [/code]            -> Add a gil cost to the cast of the ability
##  
##  [code=ItemRequirement] {Formulas} [/code]   -> Add item requirement(s) to the cast of the ability, without using it (them) directly
##                                             There can be several formulas separated by a semi-colon ;
##                                             Formulas go 2 by 2, with the 1st one defining the item ID and the 2nd one defining the item amount (default: 1)
##  
##  [code=Power] {Formula} [/code]              -> Dynamically change the ability's power
##  
##  [code=HitRate] {Formula} [/code]            -> Dynamically change the ability's hit rate
##  
##  [code=Element] {Formula} [/code]            -> Dynamically change the ability's element
##  
##  [code=Status] {Formula} [/code]             -> Dynamically change the ability's status
##  
##  [code=Target] {Formula} [/code]             -> Redefine the command's target(s)
##  
##  [code=SpecialEffect] {Formula} [/code]      -> Dynamically change the ability's special effect
##  
#####################################################################################################
##  
##  The feature "Patch" applies at any time
##  Its formula may include the same variables and functions as a "Permanent" supporting ability feature
##  
##  The feature "Priority" applies as soon as a command is sent (either as a player input or as a reaction)
##  Its formula may include the same variables and functions as below for the other features
##  
##  The other features apply when the command starts, on the tick before the "Command" supporting ability features take effect
##  before the setup of a few informations ("IsCovered" will always return false, for example)
##  Their formulas may include these variables and functions:
##    Common variables and functions, IsSingleTarget, IsSelfTarget, AreCasterAndTargetEnemies, AreCasterAndTargetAllies,
##    CasterMaxHP, CasterMaxMP, CasterMaxATB, CasterHP, CasterMP, CasterATB, CasterTrance, CasterInTrance, CasterModelId,

##  Examples:
##  
##  
##  Alternate between Fenrir (Earth) and Fenrir (Wind) when casting it, 
##  instead of patching the ability depending on Eiko's accessory
##  
##  >AA 66 Fenrir
##  [code=Patch] GetAbilityUsageCount(66) <= GetAbilityUsageCount(67) ? 66 : 67 [/code]
##  
##  
##  Curse elemental weaknesses using Amarant's weapon element when applicable,
##  and a random element if Amarant's weapon has none
##  Both of these formulas are valid for picking a random element
##  
##  >AA 129 Curse (single)
##  [code=Element] CasterWeaponElement != 0 ? CasterWeaponElement : (1 << GetRandom(0, 8)) [/code]
##  >AA 137 Curse (multi)
##  [code=Element] CasterWeaponElement != 0 ? CasterWeaponElement : GetRandomBit(255) [/code]
##  
##  
##  Have summons take priority over the other commands, once per character per battle
##  
##  >AA 49 Shiva
##  [code=Priority] CasterSummonCount <= 1 ? 1 : -1 [/code]
##  >AA 51 Ifrit

##  >AA 53 Ramuh
##  [code=Priority] CasterSummonCount <= 1 ? 1 : -1 [/code]
##  etc...
##  
##  
##  Have Shell upgrade to Mighty Guard if Concentrate is equipped
##  Note that returning the value -1 will not apply any change
##  
##  >AA 11 Shell
##  [code=Patch] HasSA(33) ? BattleAbilityId_MightyGuard : -1 [/code]
##  
##  
##  Have Haste upgrade to a party-wide spell if Concentrate is equipped
##  Note that the SFX Rework system allows to use the special effect Haste (89) on multiple targets
##  but it has to be switched to Carbuncle's Emerald effect (506) if that system is deactivated
##  
##  >AA 13 Haste
##  [code=Target] HasSA(33) ? BattleFilter(255, 1, 1, BattleStatus_Death | BattleStatus_Jump) : -1 [/code]
##  [code=SpecialEffect] HasSA(33) ? (UseSFXRework ? 89 : 506) : -1 [/code]
##  
##  
##  Have a custom Mix ability requiring 2 Ores + 1 other random jewel
##  The actual ability effect has to be coded in a custom battle script
##  (see https://github.com/Albeoris/Memoria/wiki/External-Battle-scripts)
##
