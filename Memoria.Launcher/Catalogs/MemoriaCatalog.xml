	<Description>Moguri Mod is a rework of FFIX's visuals, helped by AI and polished with love. It's a faithful experience aimed at new players, veterans and nostalgic people alike

- HD backgrounds (faithfully aided by AI, merged and polished by hand)
- All 11k layer edges manually redrawn
- Overhaul of all model textures
- Improved FMVs that merge with backgrounds
- HD places names, using original fonts
- Rework of some UI elements (maps, minimap, menu...)
- HD chocographs (based on Caledor's work with permission)
- Visual bugfixes (some by SamsamTS)

Note: 30fps videos and the alternative soundtrack are now separate mods</Description>
	<PatchNotes>Version 9.0 is a full rework of all aspects with new technologies, especially the backgrounds and battle maps.</PatchNotes>

	<CompatibilityNotes OtherModLow="MoguriFiles">Keeping Moguri at the lowest priority is surely the best:
- ".raw16" and ".raw17" assets are duplicates of the base game's assets in Moguri
- Most of the "EventEngine" assets (field event scripts and battle AI) are also duplicates, except a couple of field scripts that don't overlap with Alternate Fantasy's</CompatibilityNotes>
	<CompatibilityNotes OtherModHigh="MoguriFiles">You must move the Moguri mod to the bottom of the list for a proper installation of Alternate Fantasy</CompatibilityNotes>

	<Description>Allow the optional recruitment of Beatrix as a permanent character.
She must be met in Alexandria once the Hilda Gard III is obtained and before moving to Terra.

This is actually a lighter version of Alternate Fantasy, to benefit from its added content without changing the extensive modifications of the gameplay. Don't use both simultaneously.</Description>

	<Description>
		A hard mod that allows you to experience a new whole adventure! All the monsters and bosses have been redesigned (not only a stats boost but all the AIs are revisited), new skills, mechanics and many other things!

		Currently, Trance Seek is...
		- A thoughtfully increased difficulty, designed for players seeking challenge.
		- A complete overhaul of all combat, in terms of stats, AI and skills.
		- Around 30 new bosses added (including 2 superbosses): all the game's bosses have been reworked to offer different mechanics and more!
		- The game has a total of 84 SA + 84 additional enhanced versions (WIP).
		- All characters have 44 SA available (not counting boosted versions, so a total of 88 SA each!).
		- Each character has its own unique passive or mechanic. +40 new skills added.
		- 59 new items (WIP) !
		- And lots more ^_^

		This is not an EXTREME hardcore difficult mod: it only adds a higher difficulty than the original version while keeping a constant progression.

		It's currently a demo : Disc1/2/3 available but almost +30 hours of gameplay !
		Don't hesitate to try!

		/_!_\ IMPORTANT /_!_\
		Recommended language : Français / English (UK)
		Not supported language : Japanese (until full release... sorry !)</Description>
	<PatchNotes>
		------[0.3.30]------

		- Changes on Kuja and Necron mode at the start of the game: enemy bonuses are much less important, until Zidane/Steiner/Vivi team up in the Evil Forest.

		{Kuja Mode}:
		→ +1 Strength/Magic for enemies (instead of 25%).
		→ +5% maximum HP for enemies (instead of 10%).

		{Necron Mode} :
		→ +2 Strength/Magic for enemies. (instead of 50%)
		→ +12.5% maximum HP for enemies (instead of 25%)

		- Baku gives better rewards if defeated at the very beginning of the game (fight against Masked Man)
		- Zidane and Marcus have access to the "Steal" command against Steiner (2nd fight).
		- Slight change against the Plant Brain fight: Blank will restore all the team's HP/MP when he appears.
		- The "Heat" effect of Plant Brain's Buzz attack has been reduced by 75%.
		- Two chests edited in Prima Vista (Disc 1).
		- Correction to script 0086_AtomosScript.cs.
		- Atomos' power has been increased from 35 to 50. Like Demi, this damage depends on the target's current HP and can inflict damage on bosses.
		- Trance Seek features are availables to Mogster in the ATEs.
		- Added a new dialogue from Mogster in the swamps, about the front/back row mechanic.
		- Changed the script for the Sand Worm's "Quicksand" attack, to fix a softlock... ?
		- Fixed a bug on Amarant where he could physically attack a target under Vanish.
		- Fixed a display bug on field 2221 (Shadow/Desert Palace), where the staircase would not show up after a fight.
		- Fixed a major bug against Thorn and Zorn in Alexandria, where their HP overflowed in Kuja and Necron mode.
		- Fixed a bug where HP calculation was erroneous on Kuja/Necron difficulty on Hagen and Weimar.
		- Fixed the HPs of certain bosses in Kuja and Necron mode, where their HPs were rewritten in hard in their AI and therefore did not benefit from the HP bonus.
		- Fixed various bugs on Meltigemini, notably by improving its AI.
		- Fixed the Mog dialogue box in the Antlion pit (Disc 2 in Cleyra).
		- Fixed certain magic spells used by enemies that did not remove "Vanish".
		- Fixed Garland's mechanical armor, which could be reflected.
		- Fixed some French descriptions.</PatchNotes>

	<Description>A set of Character enhancements that powers up characters and reduces grind. Ideal for players seeking a fresh character experience without changing the story, flow, or core gameplay mechanics.

ALL Characters:
- Adds resistance to Zombie (via Auto-Life) and Virus (via Anti-Body).
- Replaces Auto-Potion with +5% HP and MP.

Transportation:
- Increases Airship and Chocobo speed.

Characters:
- Zidane gains *Pillage*, which doubles *Thievery* damage, items, and gil received after battles.
- Amarant gains *Tensai*, allowing him to learn abilities and gain experience 8x faster, balancing his late recruitment.
- Vivi gains *Aero*, *Quake*, and *Water*, each upgraded to *AGA* level.
- Steiner can equip *Save The Queen* and gains Vivi's new black magic.
- Garnet gains *Photons*, a medium Holy damage spell, to increase utility.
- Eiko’s *Titan* and *Fenrir* summons are independent: *Moonstone* grants *Fenrir*, *Sapphire* grants *Titan*.
- Quina’s *Eat* is usable at 50% enemy HP; *Cook* at 100%.
- Freya gains *High Jump* early, with *Jump* damage increased.
- Gains all enhancements in Beatrix mod / Alternate fantasy; retains stats if the Beatrix mod is off.

See the readme.txt for more details.


Mod Order:
- Place above Beatrix and Tantalus mods.
- Partially compatible with Alternate Fantasy, though some skills may interfere.

Part of Kupo Mods’ Character formerly Mog Add-ons.

<Description>[!] A new save game is recommended [!]
Removes the equipment stat-boosting mechanic and replaces it with a fixed additional per level stat-gain. Players will no longer need to mind their equipment and wear stat-boosting gear on level-up. Party members will always achieve a fixed maximum stat just by leveling. Note that this will naturally decrease the difficulty of the game due to stats having linear progression now. A new save game is required to apply these changes, but if you installed this mod mid-game, you can also visit Chocobo's Forest to inject the mod's changes, level up, and see the new stats.

Choose ONLY one of the three stats settings:

Perfect Stats
- Partially based on KADFC Max Stats Guide, this setting will allow the party to achieve near-perfect stats as if they pursued a level 1 max stats run. Significantly decreases game difficulty due to overall higher stats.

Perfect Rebalanced
- Max stats configuration by Emeiru, aims to buff party members with low combined stats and make it rebalanced across the board. 

No Bonus Stat Growth
- Completely removes the bonus stat growth formula. Optional choice to remove stat management altogether, making the game harder.

Optional: Fixed Magic Stones
- Reworks the magic stone growth formula to ensure every party member will get their max number of magic stones.</Description>

	<Description>This is the old 2020 version of the Moguri backgrounds, but with all the rest (textures, UI, fixes, edge cutting, lights...) from Moguri 9. This version's backgrounds are more pixel-perfect, paint-like, but noisier.

Moguri Mod is a rework of FFIX's visuals, helped by AI and polished with love. It's a faithful experience aimed at new players, veterans and nostalgic people alike

- HD backgrounds (faithfully aided by AI, merged and polished by hand)
- All 11k layer edges manually redrawn
- Overhaul of all model textures
- Improved FMVs that merge with backgrounds
- HD places names, using original fonts
- Rework of some UI elements (maps, minimap, menu...)
- HD chocographs (based on Caledor's work with permission)
- Visual bugfixes (some by SamsamTS)

Note: 30fps videos and the alternative soundtrack are now separate mods</Description>
	<PatchNotes>Version 8.4 has the same backgrounds as 8.3, but with some redone layer edges, lights, new battle textures, UI elements, NPC, bugfixes...</PatchNotes>

	<Description>Tradução totalmente revisada e atualizada para ser usada somente com o Mod Moguri. O jogo está completamente traduzido, incluindo história principal, diálogos secundários, sidequests, informações e outras coisas.

Informações Importantes
- Não foram traduzidos os nomes dos Itens, equipamentos e magias. Fiz essa escolha para melhor experiência dos veteranos e iniciantes.
- Ao baixar a tradução existe duas opções na pasta de instalação: 30 FPS e 60 FPS. Instale somente a versão correspondente que queira usar.
- Alguns mods são imcompatíveis com a tradução pois susbstituem os arquivos de texto ou de textura. Então verifique bem antes de instala-los.
- Para jogar a versão 60 FPS basta baixar e executar a útima versão do Memoria, encontrada aqui: (https://github.com/Albeoris/Memoria/releases/tag/v2023.06.11)

Para ver o tutorial de como instalar a tradução e acompanhar atualizações e conteúdos de FFIX entrem no meu canal.
