It includes:
- Many changes in the battle system, the enemies and the abilities
- The possibility to recruit Beatrix in the party at a certain point

	<CompatibilityNotes OtherModLow="MoguriFiles">Keeping Moguri at the lowest priority is surely the best:
- ".raw16" and ".raw17" assets are duplicates of the base game's assets in Moguri
- Most of the "EventEngine" assets (field event scripts and battle AI) are also duplicates, except a couple of field scripts that don't overlap with Alternate Fantasy's</CompatibilityNotes>
	<CompatibilityNotes OtherModHigh="MoguriFiles">You must move the Moguri mod to the bottom of the list for a proper installation of Alternate Fantasy</CompatibilityNotes>

	<Description>Allow the optional recruitment of Beatrix as a permanent character.
She must be met in Alexandria once the Hilda Gard III is obtained and before moving to Terra.

This is actually a lighter version of Alternate Fantasy, to benefit from its added content without changing the extensive modifications of the gameplay. Don't use both simultaneously.</Description>

	<IncompatibleWith>Alternate Fantasy,Amazing Quina,Beatrix Mod,Black Cat - Endgame Shop,David Bowie Edition,Freya Game+,Garnet is Main Character,Play As Kuja,Playable Character Pack,Tantalus</IncompatibleWith>
	<Description>A hard mod that allows you to experience a new whole adventure! All the monsters and bosses have been redesigned (not only a stats boost but all the AIs are revisited), new skills, mechanics and many other things!

Currently, Trance Seek is...
- A thoughtfully increased difficulty, designed for players seeking challenge.
- A complete overhaul of all combat, in terms of stats, AI and skills.
- Around 30 new bosses added (including 2 superbosses): all the game's bosses have been reworked to offer different mechanics and more!
- The game has a total of 84 SA + 84 additional enhanced versions (WIP).
- All characters have 44 SA available (not counting boosted versions, so a total of 88 SA each!).
- Each character has its own unique passive or mechanic. +40 new skills added.
- 59 new items (WIP) !
- And lots more ^_^

This is not an EXTREME hardcore difficult mod: it only adds a higher difficulty than the original version while keeping a constant progression.

It's currently a demo : CD1 + CD2 + CD3 available but almost +30 hours of gameplay !
Don't hesitate to try!

	<PatchNotes>
	------[0.3.29.2]------

	- Major hotfix for the difficulty system: "small" mistake where damage is all doubled... woopsi.
	I made an emergency hotfix a few days after this bug was reported to me, but for players who use only the Memoria launcher, they may not be aware of this fix
	if they don't update the mod... which is why i am releasing this version!
	Sorry for the disruption and enjoy!

	- Easy Kill monsters (excluding bosses) can now be scanned, especially those in Pandemonium.
	- Correction of Rataïme's dialogues in English (US) at the start of combat.
	- Modification to certain scripts (e.g. Maelstorm), where the message will display "Guard!" instead of "Miss!" if the monster is immune.
	- Correction about the targeting of the "Emerald" item.
	- Fixed some dialogues.

	------[0.3.29]------

	- [WIP] Difficulty modes now available!
	This is no definitive, but here's an idea I've had in the back of my mind for several months: the ability to choose an in-game difficulty!
	There are currently 5 difficulty levels:

	{Vivi Mode}:
	→ -50% of damage inflicted by enemies.
	→ +25% EXP gained from enemies.
	→ +25% gils gained from enemies.
	→ Venom is less lethal on players.

	{Eiko Mode}:
	→ -25% damage dealt by enemies.

	{Zidane Mode}:
	→ No modifiers ! (difficulty by default)

	{Kuja Mode}:
	→ +25% Strength/Magic for enemies.
	→ +10% maximum HP for enemies.

	{Necron Mode} :
	→ +50% Strength/Magic for enemies.
	→ +25% maximum HP for enemies.
	→ EXP gain divided by 2.
	→ Gils gain divided by 10.

	The main reason for adding this system is to give certain players a chance to discover my mod, without being blocked by the basic difficulty... or for those who like to suffer, hehe!

	I haven't necessarily tested certain difficulties in depth, especially the last ones if they make certain bosses impossible... I'll be fine-tuning this when the Disc 4 will be released, but at least the system is there!
	It's also possible to change the difficulty at any time with the Mog in the Qu's swamps => In future, this solution will no longer exist and the player will only be able to lower the difficulty
	but never raise it, which will make Necron Mode rather unique.

	- Change to the chocograph script: rollback of the forest and lagoon scripts to avoid any more problems with the mog (particularly detecting the remaining chocographs).
	From now on, certain chocographs can only be opened after a certain stage of the game => If you ever come across this type of situation, Zidane will make a reflection at a certain point in the game, which will indicate that the chocograph is open.
	which will indicate that the chocograph will be available!

	- The frogs in the swamp mini-game can no longer be played if you haven't progressed far enough in the scenario.
	It is deactivated if one of the following conditions is met:
	=> More than 10 frogs before the end of Disc 1.
	=> More than 40 frogs before the end of Disc 2.
	=> More than 70 frogs before the Shrines.

	- Reverse the reward at 80 and 90 frogs in the swamp mini-game.
	- [WIP] If the damage does not exceed 15% of the target's Maximum HP, the target will not gain Trance. The formula is not currently definitive.
	- Stop no longer triggers a Game Over.
	- Addition of the "Stop" effect on powerful monsters: this state alteration shares the same characteristics as Sleep and Freeze, i.e. the duration is reduced each time it is used.
	- Addition of the "Zombie" effect on powerful monsters: the next heal given (including absorption) is reduced to 0 and then Zombie is removed.
	- Optimised the code for "Rei's Wind".
	- The Dragon effect of "Rei's Wind" has been modified.
	- Several monsters have had their stealable/gainable items changed.
	- "Rebirth Flame" from Phoenix now removes "Vanish".
	- Smoke no longer allows you to escape certain combats.
	- Cure, Cura and Curaga spells can no longer target knocked-out allies.
	- The targeting of "Maelstorm" has been corrected following the latest Memoria update.
	- The duration of "Slow" on powerful enemies is now reduced to 70%.
	- Fixed the AI of "Sand Worm", which can generate a softlock because of Freyja.
	- Slight correction to Fabryce's AI.
	- Correction to Lovecraft's AI.
	- Lovecraft is now immune to "Gravity" attacks (to avoid a bug caused by his AI).
	- Steiner's "Sentinel" no longer reduces physical damage by 75% (rollback to 50%, due to the "Defence" status). This probably reflects a slight reworking of his passive...
	- Change to "Flawless" SA
	- Correction to the "Power Up" SA
	- AtoMoug and SidéMoug can be reflected.
	- Vivi's "Focus" no longer triggers twice if the spell is returned by Reflect and inflicts damage on other targets with a single command.
	- Fixed multiple formulas that had the wrong damage bonus (example: Berserk gave +25% damage instead of 50%).
	- Slight correction to "Racket" type weapons, which did not have the damage bonus against enemies from behind.
	- The SA "Hold Up" (as well as its boosted version) now works with "Mug".
	- "Healer" SA no longer triggers Zidane's passive.
	- The gain of gils under "Aboule Gils" and HP under "Mug+" are unified in a single message.
	- "Auto-Life" no longer works if the target is a Zombie.
	- Monsters can now use "Auto-Life", protecting them from an attack and leaving them at 1 HP.
	- It is no longer possible to collect MPs from the Prima Vista bed at Disc 1.
	- Fixed the script when Beatrix joins the team at Disc 3, where stats were calculated from level 1 and not the level when she leaves Steiner in Alexandria.
	- Fixed a display bug where the level of a status (such as Emousse) was not refreshed if the size of the model varied (via Mini for example).
	- It's now possible to fight with the Mog just before Clayra's Beatrix.
	- It's possible to save when Steiner joins Zidane, during the rescue in Alexandria (Disc 2) (and therefore before the timer).
	- Markus automatically removes all his equipment when he leaves Steiner in Alexandria (Disc 2).
	- "Chemist+" code improved.
	- Improve the code for the various SAs that can restore HP or MP.
	- Changed a few dialogues.
	- Fixed a few sequence files.</PatchNotes>

	<Description>A set of Character enhancements that powers up characters and reduces grind. Ideal for players seeking a fresh character experience without changing the story, flow, or core gameplay mechanics.

ALL Characters:
- Adds resistance to Zombie (via Auto-Life) and Virus (via Anti-Body).
- Replaces Auto-Potion with +5% HP and MP.

Transportation:
- Increases Airship and Chocobo speed.

Zidane and Amarant:
- Zidane gains *Pillage*, which doubles *Thievery* damage, items, and gil received after battles.
- Amarant gains *Tensai*, allowing him to learn abilities and gain experience 8x faster, balancing his late recruitment.

Vivi and Steiner:
- Vivi gains *Aero*, *Quake*, and *Water*, each upgraded to *AGA* level.
- Steiner can equip *Save The Queen* and gains Vivi's new black magic.

Garnet and Eiko:
- Garnet gains *Photons*, a medium Holy damage spell, to increase utility.
- Eiko’s *Titan* and *Fenrir* summons are independent: *Moonstone* grants *Fenrir*, *Sapphire* grants *Titan*.

Quina and Freya:
- Quina’s *Eat* is usable at 50% enemy HP; *Cook* at 100%.
- Freya gains *High Jump* early, with *Jump* damage increased.

Beatrix:
- Gains all enhancements in Beatrix mod / Alternate fantasy; retains stats if the Beatrix mod is off.

See the readme.txt for more details.

Mod Order:
- Place above Beatrix and Tantalus mods.
- Partially compatible with Alternate Fantasy, though some skills may interfere.

Part of Kupo Mods’ Character Enhancements, formerly Mog Add-ons.

	<Description>[!] A new save game is recommended [!]
Removes the equipment stat-boosting mechanic and replaces it with a fixed additional per level stat-gain. Players will no longer need to mind their equipment and wear stat-boosting gear on level-up. Party members will always achieve a fixed maximum stat just by leveling. Note that this will naturally decrease the difficulty of the game due to stats having linear progression now. A new save game is required to apply these changes, but if you installed this mod mid-game, you can also visit Chocobo's Forest to inject the mod's changes, level up, and see the new stats.

Choose ONLY one of the three stats settings:

Perfect Stats
- Partially based on KADFC Max Stats Guide, this setting will allow the party to achieve near-perfect stats as if they pursued a level 1 max stats run. Significantly decreases game difficulty due to overall higher stats.

Perfect Rebalanced
- Max stats configuration by Emeiru, aims to buff party members with low combined stats and make it rebalanced across the board. 

No Bonus Stat Growth
- Completely removes the bonus stat growth formula. Optional choice to remove stat management altogether, making the game harder.

Optional: Fixed Magic Stones
- Reworks the magic stone growth formula to ensure every party member will get their max number of magic stones.</Description>

The animations on the field are messed up.

You should better use the Playable Characters Pack instead. This later one doesn't aim to replace Zidane by Kuja on the field but is less experimental.</Description>

	<Author>Ze_PilOt / Snouz</Author>
	<Description>This is the old 2020 version of the Moguri backgrounds, but with all the rest (textures, UI, fixes, edge cutting, lights...) from Moguri 9. This version's backgrounds are more pixel-perfect, paint-like, but noisier.

Moguri Mod is a rework of FFIX's visuals, helped by AI and polished with love. It's a faithful experience aimed at new players, veterans and nostalgic people alike

- HD backgrounds (faithfully aided by AI, merged and polished by hand)
- All 11k layer edges manually redrawn
- Overhaul of all model textures
- Improved FMVs that merge with backgrounds
- HD places names, using original fonts
- Rework of some UI elements (maps, minimap, menu...)
- HD chocographs (based on Caledor's work with permission)
- Visual bugfixes (some by SamsamTS)

Note: 30fps videos and the alternative soundtrack are now separate mods</Description>
	<PatchNotes>Version 8.4 has the same backgrounds as 8.3, but with some redone layer edges, lights, new battle textures, UI elements, NPC, bugfixes...</PatchNotes>

	<Description>Tradução totalmente revisada e atualizada para ser usada somente com o Mod Moguri. O jogo está completamente traduzido, incluindo história principal, diálogos secundários, sidequests, informações e outras coisas.

Informações Importantes
- Não foram traduzidos os nomes dos Itens, equipamentos e magias. Fiz essa escolha para melhor experiência dos veteranos e iniciantes.
- Ao baixar a tradução existe duas opções na pasta de instalação: 30 FPS e 60 FPS. Instale somente a versão correspondente que queira usar.
- Alguns mods são imcompatíveis com a tradução pois susbstituem os arquivos de texto ou de textura. Então verifique bem antes de instala-los.
- Para jogar a versão 60 FPS basta baixar e executar a útima versão do Memoria, encontrada aqui: (https://github.com/Albeoris/Memoria/releases/tag/v2023.06.11)

Para ver o tutorial de como instalar a tradução e acompanhar atualizações e conteúdos de FFIX entrem no meu canal.
