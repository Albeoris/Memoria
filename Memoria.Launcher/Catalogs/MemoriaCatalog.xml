	<Description>Allow the optional recruitment of Beatrix as a permanent character.
She must be met in Alexandria once the Hilda Gard III is obtained and before moving to Terra.

This is actually a lighter version of Alternate Fantasy, to benefit from its added content without changing the extensive modifications of the gameplay. Don't use both simultaneously.</Description>

	<Description>
A hard mod that allows you to experience a new whole adventure! All the monsters and bosses have been redesigned (not only a stats boost but all the AIs are revisited), new skills, mechanics and many other things!

Currently, Trance Seek is...
- A thoughtfully increased difficulty, designed for players seeking challenge (5 difficulties modes available !)
- A complete overhaul of all combat, in terms of stats, AI and skills.
- Around 30 new bosses added (including 2 superbosses): all the game's bosses have been reworked to offer different mechanics and more!
- The game has a total of 84 SA + 84 additional enhanced versions (WIP).
- All characters have 60 SA available (not counting boosted versions, so a total of 120 SA each!).
- Each character has its own unique passive or mechanic. +40 new skills added.
- 59 new items... but more to come !
- And lots more ^_^

This is not an EXTREME hardcore difficult mod: it only adds a higher difficulty than the original version while keeping a constant progression.
But it's still a hard mode ! So be prepared for a challenge... you need to have a good basic understanding of the game (particularly ATB management).
The entire difficulty system will be reworked when Disc 4 is released.

It's currently a demo : Disc1/2/3 available but almost +30 hours of gameplay !
Don't hesitate to try!

	<PatchNotes>
------[0.3.34]------
Hotfix version :

{Characters}
- Fixed Vivi's "Dbl Blk" command, which was no longer linked to "Blk Mag" (fixed on 0.3.33b)

{SA / AA Skills}
- If the first strike of a magic weapon (such as scepters) misses, the second hit will not trigger.
- Correction of several descriptions, about some details.
- New FR names for some skills and commands.

{Items}
- Image" no longer removes Confusion or Sleep from a target.

{Monsters + Bosses}
- Complete rewrite of Thorn/Zorn's AI battle in Disc 2.
- Fixed Thorn's HP in Kuja/Necron mode.
- Fixed Ragtime Mouse, where questions were no longer displayed following the latest version of Memoria.

{Fields}
- Correction of some softlocks on field n°2150 (L. Castle/Royal Cham.)

------[0.3.33]------

{Features}
- A new visual + sound effect (called SPS) has been added to indicate that monsters are immune to status.
The principle is equivalent to FFX : this SPS will be played at the same time as damage to indicate whether the monster is immune to the attack's status, such as Poison or Magic Hammer.
If the spell inflicts no damage and the monster is immune to the status inflicted (like Sleep), the game will indicate that the monster is "immune".
Technically, the game will explicitly indicate whether or not the monster is immune to a status!

- Rework of the Venom status: the duration between damages (tick) is identical to Poison... but for each damage received by Venom,
it will be faster and faster (until it reaches the previously known speed).

In Vivi mode, Venom will remain at the same speed as Poison and will be unchanged.
In Necron mode, Venom will remain the same as before (meaning the status is deadly and will quickly kill the player if the ATB is not correctly managed).
In all other difficulties, the new formula explained above will now be applied.

{Characters}
- Rearrangement of all character SAs: now, all characters can learn 60 different SAs.
In addition, some SAs have been grouped together to make them more logical for the player, notably status protection and unique one for each character.
It should be noted that a large number of SAs cannot be learned for the time being: right now, i just "sorted" them... but I've included a few if you'd like to try them out :)

- A clean-up of Eiko's passive: a total rework of the code, new attacks (20 instead of 8) and the effect can be triggered at any time (base 10%), even if Eiko is not the target of an attack!
What's more, this new version is supposed to correct some minor visual problems that existed previously.
Some attacks are only unlocked once Eiko reaches a certain level, so some may not be available when she joins the team at Disc 2.

- When a character or monster is under "Defense" status, it will produce a slight sound effect when physical damage is received.
This feature is particularly useful when a monster is under this status, as nothing necessarily indicates this (unless it adopts a particular posture, like Lani).
- Total rework on the visual effect of the "Old" status.
- A character in Trance can no longer suffer "Old".

{Abilities SA / AA}
- Restoration of these white magics: Stona, Silence, Confuse and Blind. (Aero spells will have to be learn again as they have a new ID).
- 4 new black magics for Vivi: 1 of Poison, 2 of Gravity and one more. Some of these magics are not yet available in this version.
- Rework of SA Master Thief and Master Thief+. Its cost has also been reduced.
- Adjustment to SA Initiative. Its cost has also been reduced.
- Adjustment to SA High Jump and High Jump+. Its cost has also been reduced.
- Fixed a bug on Zidane's "Thief!" and "Bandit!" spells where status stacked (such as Perfect Dodge) would visually disappear.
- Corrected several formula damages, based on elemental bonuses, that were slightly wrong.
- Zidane's Warm-up grants him PowerUp in addition to his PerfectDodge.
- Corrected Larceny SA.
- The accuracy of "Maelstrom" has been increased (30 instead of 10).
- "Lucky Star" and "Lucky Star+" SA corrected.
- Correction of the "Doom" spell.
- The "Magic Hammer" spell now displays the amount of MP stolen on Kweena.
- Changed the description of the "Angel's Snack" spell to make it clearer.
- Corrected Angel's Snack's code, which did not take into account all status.
- New correction to summon sequence files (forget to upload on previous version, woops!).
- Fixed Beatrix's Cleave SFX, which aimed at invisible enemies.
- Adjustment to the AP cost of certain AA and SA.

{Items}
- The sequence files have been cleaned up and a few changes have been made to the "Scepters" weapons, meaning that :
○ Antlion's Cane, Gizamaluke's Cane and Black Waltz's Cane are now considered to be scepters, therefore losing their "Focus" bonus and being renamed.
○ Sceptres become physical weapons again (and not magical). However, the second blow is still considered to be magical.
○ Sceptres have a chance of triggering magic of different powers (weak, medium or strong).
For example: The Antlion's Scepter has a chance of triggering Fire (2 chances out of 3) or Fira (1 chance out of 3).
○ The weapon's second strike is no longer a "Counter" attack type, so it can be reflected by "Reflect" and provoke a counter from the monster.
- 2 new items added: 1 helmet and 1 accessory.
- Magic forks inflict HP damage (in addition to the MP damage that already exists) but the HP damage is much lower than a classic fork.
- Magic forks inflict less MP damage.
- New texture for the Claymore.
- Annoyntment, Remedies and Remedies+ as well as the Esuna spell now take into account the "Old" status in the target window (based on RateTarget function).
- Some descriptions have been corrected and updated.

{Monsters + Bosses}
- [WIP] New "type" of monsters: elites. There will now be "normal" monsters, "elite" monsters and "boss".
Elite monsters are quite similar to normals, but will be more resistant to deadly status such as "Death", "Petrify" and "Stop".
- New version of the Guardian of the Wind, with new animations! (Not perfect, but at least he's got some ^^)
- Black Waltz 1 is less likely to use "Tinkerbell".
- Slight correction to Black Waltz 2's "Stasis" spell, which was displaying “Miss!”.
- Earth Guardian is no longer immune to Mini.
- Changed Ogra's "Zenitude" spell.
- Corrected a softlock on Garland.
- Softlock fixed on Ralvurahva.
- Corrected two bugs on Ifa superboss AI.
- Fixed Silver Dragon's AI.
- Fixed Friendly Ladybug's AI.
- Correction of Lani's AI, following Runic's latest rework.
- Corrected Fire Guardian AI for Kuja/Necron difficulties.
- Corrected Soulcage AI, which could catch fire on neutral spells if the attacker had a Fire weapon type.
- Added a visual effect to Soulcage's mechanic: from now on, when he catches fire, he will be under the Heat effect.
- Corrected some monster attacks that did not use the correct script.
- Fixed a boss's Might spell, which was giving 5 stacks instead of 1.
- Fixed the name of some attacks.
- Improved some sequence files, which were targeting knocked-out allies.
- Corrected the AI of some battles, notably those where monsters remained at the end of a boss fight.

{Fields}
- The range for speaking to Kweena in the field Earth Shrine/Interior (no.2552) has been divided by 3.
- A menu is available just before the "You are not alone" scene, to equip any character and save.
- Corrected the script in the Water Shrine where Beatrix remained in the team if she was present.
- Added text at the start of the game, including a list of recommended mods and a warning to not use cheats, as this could break the mod (e.g. the frog minigame).
- Fixed a bug where the Field_BGM was missing after fighting a Necromancer in the Desert Palace library.
- The music is correctly preserved throughout the whole Shrines battle section.
- Multiple dialogs fixed.

{Miscellaneous}
- Code cleanup in Memoria.Scripts.dll, including better management of status application.
- Cleaned up dialog boxes generated by Memoria.Scripts.dll + translated into all languages (except some in JP).
- A super-rare easter egg has been added.... ôo</PatchNotes>

	<Description>A set of Character enhancements that powers up characters and reduces grind. Ideal for players seeking a fresh character experience without changing the story, flow, or core gameplay mechanics.

ALL Characters:
- Adds resistance to Zombie (via Auto-Life) and Virus (via Anti-Body).
- Replaces Auto-Potion with +5% HP and MP.

Transportation:
- Increases Airship and Chocobo speed.

Characters:
- Zidane gains *Pillage*, which doubles *Thievery* damage, items, and gil received after battles.
- Amarant gains *Tensai*, allowing him to learn abilities and gain experience 8x faster, balancing his late recruitment.
- Vivi gains *Aero*, *Quake*, and *Water*, each upgraded to *AGA* level.
- Steiner can equip *Save The Queen* and gains Vivi's new black magic.
- Garnet gains *Photons*, a medium Holy damage spell, to increase utility.
- Eiko’s *Titan* and *Fenrir* summons are independent: *Moonstone* grants *Fenrir*, *Sapphire* grants *Titan*.
- Quina’s *Eat* is usable at 50% enemy HP; *Cook* at 100%.
- Freya gains *High Jump* early, with *Jump* damage increased.
- Gains all enhancements in Beatrix mod / Alternate fantasy; retains stats if the Beatrix mod is off.

See the readme.txt for more details.


Mod Order:
- Place above Beatrix and Tantalus mods.
- Partially compatible with Alternate Fantasy, though some skills may interfere.

Part of Kupo Mods’ Character formerly Mog Add-ons.

<Description>[!] A new save game is recommended [!]
Removes the equipment stat-boosting mechanic and replaces it with a fixed additional per level stat-gain. Players will no longer need to mind their equipment and wear stat-boosting gear on level-up. Party members will always achieve a fixed maximum stat just by leveling. Note that this will naturally decrease the difficulty of the game due to stats having linear progression now. A new save game is required to apply these changes, but if you installed this mod mid-game, you can also visit Chocobo's Forest to inject the mod's changes, level up, and see the new stats.

Choose ONLY one of the three stats settings:

Perfect Stats
- Partially based on KADFC Max Stats Guide, this setting will allow the party to achieve near-perfect stats as if they pursued a level 1 max stats run. Significantly decreases game difficulty due to overall higher stats.

Perfect Rebalanced
- Max stats configuration by Emeiru, aims to buff party members with low combined stats and make it rebalanced across the board. 

No Bonus Stat Growth
- Completely removes the bonus stat growth formula. Optional choice to remove stat management altogether, making the game harder.

Optional: Fixed Magic Stones
- Reworks the magic stone growth formula to ensure every party member will get their max number of magic stones.</Description>

The animations on the field are messed up.

You should better use the Playable Characters Pack instead. This later one doesn't aim to replace Zidane by Kuja on the field but is less experimental.</Description>

	<Description>This is the old 2020 version of the Moguri backgrounds, but with all the rest (textures, UI, fixes, edge cutting, lights...) from Moguri 9. This version's backgrounds are more pixel-perfect, paint-like, but noisier.

Moguri Mod is a rework of FFIX's visuals, helped by AI and polished with love. It's a faithful experience aimed at new players, veterans and nostalgic people alike

- HD backgrounds (faithfully aided by AI, merged and polished by hand)
- All 11k layer edges manually redrawn
- Overhaul of all model textures
- Improved FMVs that merge with backgrounds
- HD places names, using original fonts
- Rework of some UI elements (maps, minimap, menu...)
- HD chocographs (based on Caledor's work with permission)
- Visual bugfixes (some by SamsamTS)

Note: 30fps videos and the alternative soundtrack are now separate mods</Description>
	<PatchNotes>Version 8.4 has the same backgrounds as 8.3, but with some redone layer edges, lights, new battle textures, UI elements, NPC, bugfixes...</PatchNotes>

	<Description>A mod that replaces old item, spell and UI names / labels to their modern counterparts or their now known consistent naming convention 
Ideal for those who were introduced to the series post final fantasy 12. Simply activate and that should work. 
For now the primary focus of the mod is the US and UK translation of the game so non english language players feel free to message me if you have something you want to change in your 
Language of choice.

	<Author>Harleyquinn / dkPsycho / JonasJTG</Author>
	<Description>Tradução totalmente revisada e atualizada para ser usada somente com o Mod Moguri. O jogo está completamente traduzido, incluindo história principal, diálogos secundários, sidequests, informações e outras coisas.

Informações Importantes
- Não foram traduzidos os nomes dos Itens, equipamentos e magias. Fiz essa escolha para melhor experiência dos veteranos e iniciantes.
- Ao baixar a tradução existe duas opções na pasta de instalação: 30 FPS e 60 FPS. Instale somente a versão correspondente que queira usar.
- Alguns mods são imcompatíveis com a tradução pois susbstituem os arquivos de texto ou de textura. Então verifique bem antes de instala-los.
- Para jogar a versão 60 FPS basta baixar e executar a útima versão do Memoria, encontrada aqui: (https://github.com/Albeoris/Memoria/releases/tag/v2023.06.11)

Para ver o tutorial de como instalar a tradução e acompanhar atualizações e conteúdos de FFIX entrem no meu canal.

Créditos:
- Harleyquinn: Porte para versão Moguri
- dkPsycho: Toda parte de tradução, revisão e melhoria
- JonasJTG: Edição dos Gráficos

	<Description>                        水晶的记忆    十七载的传承

        ChineseFFSkyRebirth 是一款基于 Memoria 引擎开发的中文mod，全面继承了 2008 年 《最终幻想 IX》PS 版汉化版的所有元素，并在此基础上进行了进一步的优化与提升。

        本作不仅完整保留了当年汉化组的工作成果，还在Memoria引擎的帮助下进行了多项增强，使得这款经典汉化版在新技术的加持下焕发新生。

        包括：1、天幻版文本移植与改进。2、含文字的图片汉化。3、所有场景地名图片汉化且调整尺寸适应大屏幕。4、开场和结局动画的优化处理。

        我们致敬原最终幻想9汉化组的所有成员，诚挚感谢memoria引擎成员Tirlititi的无私帮助，同时也向为本mod付出热情和贡献的朋友致以最高的敬意。

        Team "Tribute to FFIX cn 2008" 祝您游戏愉快！</Description>
