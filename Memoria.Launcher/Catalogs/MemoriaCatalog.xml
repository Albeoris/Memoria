	<Description>Allow the optional recruitment of Beatrix as a permanent character.
She must be met in Alexandria once the Hilda Gard III is obtained and before moving to Terra.

This is actually a lighter version of Alternate Fantasy, to benefit from its added content without changing the extensive modifications of the gameplay. Don't use both simultaneously.</Description>

	<Description>
A hard mod that allows you to experience a new whole adventure! All the monsters and bosses have been redesigned (not only a stats boost but all the AIs are revisited), new skills, mechanics and many other things!

Currently, Trance Seek is...
- A thoughtfully increased difficulty, designed for players seeking challenge (5 difficulties modes available !)
- A complete overhaul of all combat, in terms of stats, AI and skills.
- Around 30 new bosses added (including 2 superbosses): all the game's bosses have been reworked to offer different mechanics and more!
- The game has a total of 84 SA + 84 additional enhanced versions (WIP).
- All characters have 60 SA available (not counting boosted versions, so a total of 120 SA each!).
- Each character has its own unique passive or mechanic. +40 new skills added.
- 59 new items... but more to come !
- And lots more ^_^

This is not an EXTREME hardcore difficult mod: it only adds a higher difficulty than the original version while keeping a constant progression.
But it's still a hard mode ! So be prepared for a challenge... you need to have a good basic understanding of the game (particularly ATB management).
The entire difficulty system will be reworked when Disc 4 is released.

It's currently a demo : Disc1/2/3 available but almost +30 hours of gameplay !
Don't hesitate to try!

	<Description>
A very lightweight mod that allows you to modify minor elements of the game while keeping as much of the OG experience as possible.
All options are independent and can be activated as desired.
More options will be added over time.
Note : To avoid compatibility issues, Quality of the Ifa should be sorted to the lowest priority in the mod list.

	<IncompatibleWith>AlternateFantasy, Trance Seek, David Bowie Edition, Beatrix Mod</IncompatibleWith>
	<Description>
A mod that simply consists of changing all your characters into a specific one... have you always dreamed of having four Vivis burning everything? A rain of spears from the sky with your Freyas? Or an army of Quina eating monsters by dozens?

Inspired by the AllQuinaMod mod by Tetra Gomez (aka 8bitmissingno), based on an idea from the Twitch streamer NocturnalHanna.
So why just settle for Quina and do this for all the characters... that's what DV offers in this mod!

NoHardcodedBattles mod already included !
Compatible with the OG version only.

Coming soon : For the next version, I will try to make a mini .dll file so that the mod is compatible with PCP for example.

	<Description>Adds new playable characters to the roster.

Please Note: 
- Still only playable in US Language only (will be fixed in a later release)
- Requires Memoria v2025.05.11 or later
- Currently this mod is not compatible with Trance Seek, but I plan on getting it to eventually
- Currently Alternate Fantasy will have some nuances like Cheat Fate, Fidget, Auto-Protect/Shell missing (this will be fixed in a later update of PCP)

Currently, these characters are added:
- Kuja
- Fratley
- Lani
- Haagen
- Kohel
- Aria (Alexandrian soldier)
- Ophelia (Alexandrian soldier)
- Dan
- Jeame (Cleyra dancer)
- Puck
- Mikoto
- Gerome (Genome)
- Ruby
- Baku

You can press Alt+F2 or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F2 if on Linux in-game to access the party menu (changing the party at any time is a feature of Memoria, not related to this mod).

Special Thanks for their important help:
- LucyHale00 for bug reporting
- HsienkoMegatonDrop for bug reporting
- Emeiru (support)
- Hope (scripting)
- faospark (concept art)
- samtoki (character portraits)
- DV (ability sequences and features)

You should set the priority of this mod to be higher than the priority of the Moguri mod but lower than other mods, but until Alternate Fantasy's next update, put this mod's priority above it</Description>

<Description>[!] A new save game is recommended [!]
Removes the equipment stat-boosting mechanic and replaces it with a fixed additional per level stat-gain. Players will no longer need to mind their equipment and wear stat-boosting gear on level-up. Party members will always achieve a fixed maximum stat just by leveling. Note that this will naturally decrease the difficulty of the game due to stats having linear progression now. A new save game is required to apply these changes, but if you installed this mod mid-game, you can also visit Chocobo's Forest to inject the mod's changes, level up, and see the new stats.

Choose ONLY one of the three stats settings:

Perfect Stats
- Partially based on KADFC Max Stats Guide, this setting will allow the party to achieve near-perfect stats as if they pursued a level 1 max stats run. Significantly decreases game difficulty due to overall higher stats.

Perfect Rebalanced
- Max stats configuration by Emeiru, aims to buff party members with low combined stats and make it rebalanced across the board. 

No Bonus Stat Growth
- Completely removes the bonus stat growth formula. Optional choice to remove stat management altogether, making the game harder.

Optional: Fixed Magic Stones
- Reworks the magic stone growth formula to ensure every party member will get their max number of magic stones.</Description>

	<MinimumMemoriaVersion>2025-05-11</MinimumMemoriaVersion>
	<Description>Changes some Support Abilities to be "subjectively" more useful! You can enable as many as you want. 


Divine Light - (Replaces "Auto-Reflect" Support Ability)
- Completely drains the Trance bar to stop a character from being KO'd if the Trance bar is at least 50% full.


Trancer - (Replaces "Ability Up" Support Ability)
- All attacks now slightly increase the Trance gauge.
- High Tide increases the amount of Trance gained.
- HIGHLY suggested you use this option with "Kupo Tweaks or Exp , AP, Gil , Rewards Modifier" mod to alter AP gains from losing the Ability Up support ability.


Gambling Strikes - (Replaces Zidane's "Bandit" Support Ability)
- Zidane's damage output randomly ranges from 50% to 200%.
- HIGHLY suggested you enable "100% Steal Rate" cheat in Memoria engine to offset losing the Bandit support ability.


Glass Cannon - (Replaces "Auto-Float" Support Ability)
- Increases all damage dealt by 60%, but reduces MaxHP by 40%.


Dyne Booster - (Zidane Only)
- All of Zidane's Trance abilities deals 2x damage when his HP falls below 20%.
- Damage at endgame will easily hit 9,999 damage cap when this triggers.
- (OPTIONAL) Enable "Break Damage Limit" cheat in Memoria Engine to allow damage to break 9,999 cap.


Defence+ - (Replaces "Gambler Defense" Support Ability)
- Gambler Defense was an abysmally useless Special Ability.
- Now increases Defence and Magic Defence by 5%.


Lucky! - (Replaces "Level Up" Support Ability)
- There are a few mods out there that allow you that alter your EXP gain... so, I figured the "Level Up" support ability could get a facelift. 
- Now increases Critical Strike Chance by 10!


HP Leech - (Replaces "Add Status" Support Ability)
- Attacks will now leech a small amount of HP from the target to heal the user.
- The "Add Status" is now a global passive - no longer needing to be equipped for the effect to be active. Always found it kinda pointless to add Status Effects to weapons and then making them moot if you didn't have this Support Ability equipped. 


MP Leech - (Replaces "MP Attack" Support Ability)
- Attacks will now leech a small amount of MP from the target to heal the user.
- This ability makes sense in my game because I'm playing the Alternate Fantasy mod and almost all my characters now have skills that deal damage and use MP, so there is no reason to drain my MP to use a regular attack when I could just use one of my skills and do the same thing.


Speed+ - (Replaces "Flee-Gil" Support Ability)
- Flee-Gil is actual doodoo, now it's actually useful!
- Now increases Speed by 10%.

	<PatchNotes>Requires Memoria between v2021.05.10 and v2022.09.09 to work in battles</PatchNotes>
	<Description>Turn Zidane's 3D model on the field and in battles into Kuja's 3D model.
The animations on the field are messed up.

You should better use the Playable Characters Pack instead. This later one doesn't aim to replace Zidane by Kuja on the field but is less experimental.</Description>

	<ReleaseDateOriginal>2025-06-23</ReleaseDateOriginal>
	<Description>Mistwake UI is more than just a visual overhaul of Final Fantasy IX — it’s a tribute.
Created by fans who grew up mesmerized by every detail of this masterpiece, the mod was born out of a desire to give back for the impact the game had on our lives. With a respectful and meticulous reinterpretation, we aimed to honor everything that made FFIX a classic of the 2000s, enhancing its beauty through a fresh perspective.

This version includes:

A redesigned look for menus, interface, dialogue boxes, and other refined elements
New portraits for all characters, including side characters and extras
Exclusive new artwork for each of the 8 protagonists at the moment they are recruited
New background illustrations for the title screen, Game Over, and disc transitions
New map name presentations, now accompanied by icons that represent each location
Mistwake is a love letter to the world of Gaia — and a gift to everyone who, like us, was moved by it.

PT-BR

Mistwake UI é mais do que uma repaginação visual de Final Fantasy IX — é uma homenagem.
Criado por fãs que cresceram encantados com cada detalhe dessa obra-prima, o mod nasceu do desejo de retribuir o impacto que o jogo teve em nossas vidas. Com uma releitura respeitosa e detalhista, buscamos valorizar tudo o que fez de FFIX um clássico dos anos 2000, exaltando sua beleza com um novo olhar.

Esta versão inclui:
Novo visual para menus, interface, caixa de diálogo e outros elementos refinados
Novos retratos para todos os personagens, incluindo secundários e extras
Novas artes exclusivas para cada um dos 8 protagonistas no momento em que são recrutados
Novas artes de fundo, para a tela inicial, Game Over e transições de disco
Novas apresentações dos nomes de mapas, agora acompanhadas por ícones que representam cada local

Mistwake é uma carta de amor ao mundo de Gaia — e um presente para todos que, como nós, se emocionaram com ele.
</Description>
	<PatchNotes>IMPORTANT: To experience the mod in its most refined form, we recommend using the Newsreader 14pt font. It is not enabled by default, but it is included in the mod package. Simply install it and select it manually in the Memoria launcher settings to enjoy all the visual elegance that Mistwake offers.

PT-BR

IMPORTANTE: Para vivenciar o mod em sua forma mais refinada, recomendamos o uso da fonte Newsreader 14pt. Ela não está ativada por padrão, mas está inclusa no pacote do mod. Basta instalá-la e selecioná-la manualmente nas configurações no launcher do Memoria e aproveitar toda a elegância visual que Mistwake propõe.</PatchNotes>

	<Description>This is the old 2020 version of the Moguri backgrounds, but with all the rest (textures, UI, fixes, edge cutting, lights...) from Moguri 9. This version's backgrounds are more pixel-perfect, paint-like, but noisier.

Moguri Mod is a rework of FFIX's visuals, helped by AI and polished with love. It's a faithful experience aimed at new players, veterans and nostalgic people alike

- HD backgrounds (faithfully aided by AI, merged and polished by hand)
- All 11k layer edges manually redrawn
- Overhaul of all model textures
- Improved FMVs that merge with backgrounds
- HD places names, using original fonts
- Rework of some UI elements (maps, minimap, menu...)
- HD chocographs (based on Caledor's work with permission)
- Visual bugfixes (some by SamsamTS)

Note: 30fps videos and the alternative soundtrack are now separate mods</Description>
	<PatchNotes>Version 8.4 has the same backgrounds as 8.3, but with some redone layer edges, lights, new battle textures, UI elements, NPC, bugfixes...</PatchNotes>

Ideal for those who were introduced to the series post final fantasy 12. Simply activate and that should work.

Language of choice.

	<Description>Tradução totalmente revisada e atualizada para ser usada somente com o Mod Moguri. O jogo está completamente traduzido, incluindo história principal, diálogos secundários, sidequests, informações e outras coisas.

Informações Importantes
- Não foram traduzidos os nomes dos Itens, equipamentos e magias. Fiz essa escolha para melhor experiência dos veteranos e iniciantes.
- Ao baixar a tradução existe duas opções na pasta de instalação: 30 FPS e 60 FPS. Instale somente a versão correspondente que queira usar.
- Alguns mods são imcompatíveis com a tradução pois susbstituem os arquivos de texto ou de textura. Então verifique bem antes de instala-los.
- Para jogar a versão 60 FPS basta baixar e executar a útima versão do Memoria, encontrada aqui: (https://github.com/Albeoris/Memoria/releases/tag/v2023.06.11)

Para ver o tutorial de como instalar a tradução e acompanhar atualizações e conteúdos de FFIX entrem no meu canal.

- Harleyquinn: Porte para versão Moguri
- dkPsycho: Toda parte de tradução, revisão e melhoria
- JonasJTG: Edição dos Gráficos

	<Description>                        水晶的记忆    十七载的传承

        ChineseFFSkyRebirth 是一款基于 Memoria 引擎开发的中文mod，全面继承了 2008 年 《最终幻想 IX》PS 版汉化版的所有元素，并在此基础上进行了进一步的优化与提升。

        本作不仅完整保留了当年汉化组的工作成果，还在Memoria引擎的帮助下进行了多项增强，使得这款经典汉化版在新技术的加持下焕发新生。

        包括：1、天幻版文本移植与改进。2、含文字的图片汉化。3、所有场景地名图片汉化且调整尺寸适应大屏幕。4、开场和结局动画的优化处理。

        我们致敬原最终幻想9汉化组的所有成员，诚挚感谢memoria引擎成员Tirlititi的无私帮助，同时也向为本mod付出热情和贡献的朋友致以最高的敬意。

        Team "Tribute to FFIX cn 2008" 祝您游戏愉快！</Description>
	<PatchNotes>Version 0.9 为最终幻想IX 2008年ps版汉化的移植作品，在此基础上重新制作和调整了全部图片部分，以及结局动画。</PatchNotes>
