# DEVELOPERS


## Build & Contribute
- Use Visual Studio Community (2019 or above). Install .NET dev tools when prompted.
- In Visual Studio, install ".NET Framework 3.5 Development Tools" & "Visual Studio Tools for Unity" (in Tools > Get Tools and Functionalities > Individual Components <>)
- Install [.NET Framework 3.5 SP1 and 4.6.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/visual-studio-sdks?cid=getdotnetsdk).
- Make a fork of the project and download it locally.
- Open Powershell as administrator and execute `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine`
- Change directory to your Memoria Fork download location and run powershell script `.\SetupProjectEnvironment.ps1`
- Once you've commited your changes to your fork, make it a Pull Request to the main repository.
- I recommend Github Desktop for easy push to repository.


## Scripting
1. Make a copy of an existing item from the "StreamingAssets\Scripts" folder.
2. Change a namespace to your own.
3. Make some changes.
4. Run Memoria.Compiler.exe from the "Compiler".
5. Run the game, test what you need and see Memoria.log and output_log.txt for errors.

Now you can change mechanics of battle actions. In the future, I will add more scriptable entries.
Also, you can use a Visual Studio project from the "Project" folder. It will load every .cs file from the "Sources\Battle" folder.
Be careful - future updates could remove your changes. Please make your own copies if it possible.

## Restrictions
1. **Please** don't change any data that can be sent to the game server! We don't want any trouble.
2. Don't change a serializable data that can be deserialized by the Unity Engine. The game will crash or corrupt.


## Debug
1. Check the "Debuggable" checkbox in the Launcher.
2. Attach to the game process (Debug -> Attach Unity Debugger in the Visual Studio 2015/2017 Tools for Unity)
