### The Memoria engine is an open-source community rewrite of Final Fantasy IX's engine that aims to add features, fix bugs and expand modding possibilities. It includes built-in improvements (QoL, camera, framerate, audio, controller, UI, options, cheats, shaders...), bugfixes, a mod manager/downloader and a model viewer.

## Use

- **INSTALL**
  - (Windows): Download and run [Memoria.Patcher.exe](https://github.com/Albeoris/Memoria/releases/latest/download/Memoria.Patcher.exe)
    - Automatically finds the game path from Windows registry (if you've launched the game once and haven't moved the install folder) (If not, launch the patcher from the game folder, or provide a custom path in command line: 'Memoria.Patcher.exe "gameDirectory"')
  - (Steam Deck / Linux) run this in the Konsole/terminal:
  - `bash -c "$(curl -sL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dotaxis/1ad1c64baa7ad9c1dabcb255ea6257ae/raw/memoria.sh)"`
  - (Mac): The launcher has been shown to be currently only compatible with Crossover in Windows 7 32bit mode (Whiskey and 64bit give an error "mono-io-layer-error")
- **UPDATE**
  - Run the latest patcher exe or use "check for updates" in the launcher
  - The Mod Manager will show a yellow dot if some of your mods are not up-to-date
- **CONFIGURE**
  - Most crucial options and cheats are embedded in the game launcher
  - More in-depth configuration is available in the file Memoria.ini (in the game folder)
